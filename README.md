the code is written in order of appearance of sections in viewport, but css code is not optimised, it is written as spagetti code, but i tried to make,
most of the animations with css, so a lot of code is written in css.

i tried to keep the javascript to minimal amount, so there is very less javascript code, probably less than 20 lines. 

and all icons and images used in this page are just listed down here one by one with out ordering and gruping. 

everything is just plain HTML , CSS and JavaScript without using any libraries.
